This is a Python script for a Streamlit app that analyzes images to determine whether they are real or fake. The app uses a Keras model trained on the CASIA dataset to make predictions.

Here's an overview of the script:

1. Import necessary libraries and set up the app's layout.
2. Define functions for downloading files, loading a Keras model from Hugging Face, applying a filter to an image, preparing an image for the model, and converting an image to an ELA image.
3. Set up the app's title and file uploader.
4. If an image is uploaded, load the Keras model and make a prediction.
5. Apply a filter to the image based on the prediction and display the filtered image.
6. Display the source of the data used to train the model.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the script:

### Import necessary libraries and set up the app's layout

The script imports necessary libraries such as `os`, `requests`, `keras`, `streamlit`, `numpy`, and `PIL`. It also sets the environment variable `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` to an empty string, which will be used later to download a Keras model from Hugging Face.

The script then defines some constants such as `class_names`, `image_size`, and `POLICE`.

### Define functions

The script defines several functions:

* `download_file`: This function downloads a file from a URL and saves it to a local path.
* `load_keras_model_from_hub`: This function downloads a Keras model from Hugging Face and saves it to a local path.
* `apply_fake_filter`: This function applies a filter to an image based on its predicted fake score and additional text.
* `prepare_image`: This function prepares an image for the Keras model by converting it to an ELA image and resizing it to the model's input shape.
* `convert_to_ela_image`: This function converts an image to an ELA image by saving it as a JPEG with a specified quality and then computing the difference between the original and compressed images.

### Set up the app's title and file uploader

The script sets up the app's title and file uploader using Streamlit. The file uploader allows the user to select an image file in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.

### If an image is uploaded, load the Keras model and make a prediction

If an image is uploaded, the script first tries to load the Keras model from a local file. If the model is not found, it downloads the model from Hugging Face using `load_keras_model_from_hub`.

The script then prepares the image using `prepare_image` and makes a prediction using the model. It displays the predicted class (real or fake) and confidence score.

### Apply a filter to the image based on the prediction and display the filtered image

The script applies a filter to the image using `apply_fake_filter` based on the predicted fake score and class. It then displays the filtered image using Streamlit.

### Display the source of the data used to train the model

Finally, the script displays a markdown message indicating the source of the data used to train the model. The data comes from the CASIA dataset available on Kaggle, shared by Sophatvathana.
